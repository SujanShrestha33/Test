                Integrated Curriculum</h1>
            <p>An integrated curriculum is an educational approach that combines several topics, including Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), the Arts (STEAM), and Reading (STREAM), to produce a cogent and comprehensive learning experience (Knaus & Roberts, 2017). The STEMIE framework, which combines STEM, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, attempts to educate children to adopt a spirit of innovation and use creative problem-solving techniques (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, 2016).</p>
            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p>
                •	Young children's critical thinking, problem-solving, and creative talents are encouraged to grow through the implementation of an integrated curriculum (Knaus & Roberts, 2017). <br>
•	It offers opportunities for children to acquire various skills, such as cooperation, communication, and collaboration—crucial for success in the workplace and personal relationships (Lange, Brenneman, & Mano, 2019). <br>
•	Learning becomes more meaningful and applicable for young children as a result of the integrated curriculum (Advancing STEM, 2016).
•	Early exposure to STEM subjects may assist in the development of young children's problem-solving, creativity, and critical-thinking abilities (Lange, Brenneman, & Mano, 2019; Knaus & Roberts, 2017). <br>
•	According to Advancing STEM (2016), the Australian Government has acknowledged the value of STEM education in helping young children in Australia develop their creativity and ingenuity.

            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p> •	LEGO Education sets: With the help of LEGO Education sets like LEGO Education WeDo 2.0, STEM principles may be taught in a fun and interesting way. These kits include lesson ideas and exercises that follow early education standards. <br>

                •	Science kits: Like those from Thames & Kosmos or Steve Spangler Science, science kits give young children hands-on learning opportunities. The supplies and instructions for experiments covering a variety of STEM ideas are included in these kits (Steve Spangler Science, n.d.; Thames & Kosmos, n.d.). <br>
                
                •	Coding games: Coding games, like ScratchJr or Code.org, can aid in the growth of young children's computational thinking and coding abilities. These games are designed to be entertaining and suitable for all ages. <br>
                
                •	Arts & crafts supplies: You may include the arts in STEM classes by using supplies like paint, paper, glue, and scissors. By painting a plant cell or building a bridge model, children may make art that links to STEM ideas. <br>
                
                •	Books and literature: Children's books and other works of literature can be utilised to include reading in STEM training.
                •	Interactive whiteboards: SMART Boards and Promethean Boards are two examples of interactive whiteboards that may be used to engage children in multimedia lessons that include movies and animations (SMART Board, n.d.; Promethean, n.d.). <br>
                
                These are only a few examples of the numerous tools, supplies, and electronic gadgets that may be utilised to get children interested in the integrated curriculum. Additionally, teachers can use their imagination to develop concepts for fun activities that include STEM, STEAM, STREAM, or STEMIE topics.

            <h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                Following are some learning activities that early childhood educators might use in the Integrated Curriculum (STEM, STEAM, STREAM, & STEMIE) across various age groups to foster young children's creativity: <br>

                0-2 years: <br>
                
                •	Sensory exploration: To promote exploration and sensory development, offer a variety of materials with various textures, colours, and flavours, such as sand, water, playdough, and paint. <br>
                •	Music and movement: Play a variety of music and encourage children to move and dance to the rhythm while they investigate cause-and-effect relationships with a variety of musical toys and instruments. <br>
                
                2-3 years: <br>
                
                •	Building with blocks: It is a great way to introduce toddlers to balance, size, and form ideas while encouraging them to build a variety of buildings. <br>
                •	basic experiments: Create basic experiments with common items like water, food colouring, and baking soda to help children to investigate cause-and-effect relationships. <br>
                
                3-5 years (Lange, Brenneman, & Mano, 2019): <br>
                
                •	Nature walks and observations: Take children on nature hikes and encourage them to examine and gather various items like leaves, pebbles, and flowers while they learn about various scientific concepts like categorisation and identification. <br>
                •	Role play and storytelling: Encourage children to participate in role-playing and storytelling games using a variety of materials and objects to explore their creativity and improve their language skills. <br>

            <h2>Pedagogies</h2>
                <p>
                    Early childhood educators can utilise the following pedagogical approaches and teaching methods to integrate creativity into the Integrated curriculum (STEM, STEAM, STREAM & STEMIE): <br>

•	Inquiry-based learning: Encourage children to explore, enquire about, and study their surroundings while using their imaginations to come up with answers and answers for issues (Department of Education and Training, 2018, p. 9). <br>

•	Play-based learning: Give children the chance to engage in unstructured play activities that promote creativity, experimentation, and discovery (Early Childhood Australia, 2019, para. 1). <br>

•	Project-based learning: Encourage children to work on long projects that let them thoroughly research a subject and then use their imaginations to come up with original answers and ideas (Early Learning STEM Australia, n.d., para. 2). <br>

•	Collaborative learning: Encourage children to collaborate and share their knowledge and ideas with others so that they can generate fresh, original ideas (Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority, 2019, p. 6). <br>

•	Problem-solving: Give children the tools they need to apply their imagination to practical issues and give them an opportunity to test and improve their ideas (Department of Education and Training, 2018, p. 10). <br>

•	Reflection: Encourage children to reflect on their learning experiences and use their imaginations to develop fresh concepts and insights (Early Childhood Australia, 2018, para. 5). <br>

•	Use of technology: To encourage creativity and problem-solving, use digital tools such as iPads, interactive whiteboards, and educational apps (Department of Education and Training, 2018, p. 11). <br>

•	Flexible learning environments: Construct open areas for learning where children may wander about and participate in various educational activities (Early Childhood Australia, 2019, para. 6).
