            <h1>Engineering</h1>
            <p>Engineering is the application of mathematical and scientific techniques to plan, create, and manage systems, devices, and processes that address issues or enhance current ones (National Society of Professional Engineers, 2021). This line of work calls for creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p>
                •	The development of young children's creativity requires engineering on a large scale. <br>
•	Children may explore, experiment, and solve problems through engineering-related activities, which are essential skills for creative development. <br>
•	Children are encouraged to investigate, experiment, and ask questions as part of engineering activities in order to examine at issues from several perspectives and come up with fresh answers. <br>
•	Trial and error is a necessary component of the creative process, and engineering tasks encourage resilience (Cohen & Baikadi, 2018).
•	The collaborative spirit and sense of teamwork are fostered through engineering activities. <br>
•	Activities in engineering provide chances for young children to practise critical thinking, which helps them analyse issues and come up with original, creative solutions (Mayesky, 2015). <br>
•	According to Pantoya, Aguirre-Munoz, & Hunt (2015), children can acquire the necessary abilities to become innovative issue solvers and creative problem solvers by introducing engineering activities into early childhood education.

            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p> •	Engineering exercises may be carried out with construction toys, recyclable materials, and STEM kits. <br>
                •	Engineering tasks may be improved with the use of digital technology like interactive whiteboards, tablets, and laptops. <br>
                •	It is possible to get children interested in engineering through the usage of applications. <br>
                •	Children can be introduced to engineering ideas and motivated to participate in engineering activities through the use of engineering books and guest speakers. <br>
                •	These materials may be used to provide a rich and stimulating learning environment that promotes creativity and motivates children to explore, experiment, and solve problems.

            <h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                0-2 years  <br>

sensory exploration <br>
Give infants a variety of textures, shapes, and colours to explore and play with. Toys like softballs, wooden blocks, and sensory bags containing water, sand, or rice are good examples of goods to have on hand. <br>

Results and effect: <br>
Engage infants in play that involves adjusting items to elicit a reaction. Give children toys that light up when touched or create noise when shaken. <br>

2-3 years <br>
constructing buildings <br>
Allow young children to make and destroy buildings by providing building blocks, stacking cups, or construction toys. <br>
Encourage the exploration of various construction methods and materials. <br>

Simple gadgets <br>
Introduce ramps, levers, and other basic machinery to young children. <br>
Use playthings or household items <br>
3-5 years <br>
Engineering challenges: <br>
Offer challenges in technology like constructing a tower or bridge that can hold weight. <br>
Encourage cooperation and creative problem-solving to overcome the difficulty. <br>

Design and Create: <br>
Encourage young children to design and build their own machines or constructions out of cardboard, paper, and other recyclable materials. <br>
Give them supplies like scissors, tape, and glue so they can make their creations come to life. <br>

6-8 years <br>
Robotics: Use robotics kits or programming strategies to build basic robots to introduce robotics to primary school-aged children. <br>
Encourage experimentation and modifications to the design to accomplish various objectives. <br>

Engineering investigations: <br>
Engage children in engineering research, such as examining how various materials impact a structure's strength or measuring the speed of various types of vehicles. <br>
Encourage students to do research and make conclusions utilising the scientific approach. </p>

            <h2>Pedagogies</h2>
                <p>
                    •	Early childhood educators can use the following pedagogical approaches and instructional techniques to promote creativity in the engineering curriculum area: <br>

•	Open-ended exploration: Encourage open-ended investigation by giving children a chance to investigate objects and concepts in various ways that will help them come up with their own answers and concepts (Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2015). <br>

•	Provide children with an array of supplies: Give children a range of supplies to use in their engineering projects, such as blocks, magnets, gears, and pulleys. <br>

•	Foster Collaboration: Encourage children to work together in groups to share ideas, work through issues, and draw on one another's creativity. <br>

•	Support risk-taking: Encourage children to take chances and attempt new things without worrying about being rejected or failing by others by creating a safe atmosphere for them to do so. <br>

•	Raise open-ended enquiries: Ask open-ended questions like, "What do you think will happen if...?" or "How could we make this better" to inspire children to think critically and imaginatively (Department of Education and Training, Victoria, 2016). <br>

•	Provide opportunities for reflection: Create chances for self-analysis. According to Education Services Australia (2017), asking them questions such, as "What did you learn?" or "What would you do differently next time?" will help them reflect on their engineering projects. <br>

•	Incorporate storytelling and imagination: Encourage children to include storytelling and imagination in their engineering projects by having them design robots with specific missions or construct castles for characters from fairy tales. <br>

Early childhood educators may encourage creativity in the engineering curriculum by implementing these pedagogical practices and teaching techniques. This will help children gain problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills, and an enthusiasm for STEM areas (Australian Government, Department of Education and Training, 2016).
