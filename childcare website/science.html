            <h1>Science</h1>
            <p>Early childhood education's science curriculum strongly emphasises encouraging young children to develop their scientific thinking and enquiry abilities (Mayesky, 2015). It entails giving children the chance to learn about and interact with nature through practical, experiential learning opportunities. The objectives are building a basis for future scientific study, strengthening critical thinking abilities, and encouraging worldly curiosity.</p>
            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p>
                •	Early science education fosters creativity by cultivating a questioning and inquisitive mindset ("The Power of Science in Early Learning," Department of Education, Queensland, n.d.). <br>
•	It encourages the development of critical thinking abilities through observation, analysis, and assessment. <br>
•	According to ICTE Solutions, “Science and Technology in Early Childhood Education," Science-related activities offer opportunities for immersive, hands-on learning, which boosts creativity. <br>
•	Science encourages experimentation and invention, which lets children take calculated risks. <br>
•	Science-based connections to the natural world can stimulate artistic, literary, and intellectual endeavours (Mayesky, 2015).

            <p>Incorporating a variety of resources, materials, and digital technologies can help early childhood teachers create engaging and interactive science activities that foster children's curiosity, critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills. It's important to consider the age, developmental level, and interests of the children when selecting and utilizing these resources to ensure they are appropriate and engaging for their learning needs as stated in Australian Curriculum (Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2015).</p>
            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p> •	Engaging scientific activities may be conducted in early childhood schools using hands-on materials, natural materials, science publications, and digital tools. <br>
                •	Science tools, instructional websites, and applications may offer engaging, interactive learning opportunities. <br>
                •	Real-world possibilities for scientific enquiry may be provided through nature walks, field trips, and local resources. <br>
                •	Building and creating scientific models may be done using recyclable materials. <br>
                •	Science kits and early childhood curriculum resources can offer well-structured lesson plans and tools for integrating science into the curriculum .

            <h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                0-2 years: <br>

•	Sensory exploration: Encourage infants to engage in sensory exploration by letting them feel the water, sand, or other natural materials to pique their interest and develop observational skills. <br>
•	Nature walks: Take infants on nature walks to expose them to the various sights, sounds, and sensations of the natural world. This will foster an early love of science and nature. <br>

2-3 years: <br>

•	Planting seeds: Giving toddlers the chance to plant and care for seeds while observing their growth and changes over time can encourage their curiosity about plants and the natural world. <br>
•	Sink or float: Set up a sensory bin or water table for toddlers to explore which things float or sink, encouraging discovery, observation, and critical thinking abilities. <br>

3-5 years: <br>

•	Science experiments: Simple scientific experiments may be performed to assist young children to make hypotheses, examining things, and reflecting. <br>
•	Nature observations: Take young children on walks or field excursions to observe and learn about the natural world. This will encourage their curiosity and their ability to notice and enquire. <br>

6-8 years: <br>

•	Inquiry-based projects: Projects that are based on enquiry should be encouraged. By providing children with the tools they need to plan, research, and execute their projects, educators can help them develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. <br>
•	Design and build: Provide children with the necessary resources to design and construct machines or buildings. This will foster their creativity, ingenuity, and engineering abilities. <br>

We should always prioritise safety and supervision during science activities and remember to tailor these learning experiences to the unique needs and interests of the children in your early childhood environment.</p>

            <h2>Pedagogies</h2>
                <p>
                    1.	Inquiry-based learning: Encourage children to research, explore, and ask questions about their interests in the science curriculum. <br>

                    2.	Play-based learning: Including play in science-related activities to encourage problem-solving, experimentation, and imaginative play (Pegg, Dole, and Steinle, 2017). <br>
                    
                    3.	Collaborative learning: Fostering conversation and peer-to-peer learning among children while encouraging teamwork and cooperation. <br>
                    
                    4.	Flexibility and adaptability: Being receptive to the opinions, enquiries, and interests of the students and modifying lesson plans as necessary. <br>
                    
                    5.	Reflection and Documentation: Children should be encouraged to reflect on their learning and record their conclusions in writing, drawings, or other creative mediums. <br>
                    
                    6.	Technology integration: Using age-appropriate technology to improve science learning opportunities and advance analytical and problem-solving abilities (Moomaw, 2019). <br>
                    
                    Building a friendly, welcoming setting that promotes experimentation, risk-taking, and creative expression is vital to promoting a pleasant learning environment.<br>

7.	Individualised instruction: Supporting individual interests, aptitudes, and learning preferences to provide individualised learning experiences (Fleet & Patterson, 2014).
